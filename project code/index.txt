Main file:
GUI.m  

Function files:
AreaOfInterest.m
Segmentation.m
NN_Digit_Recognition.m
NN_Letter_Recognition.m

Neural Network Training Files:
NeuroTrainingNumbers.m
NeuroTrainingLetters.m


The function files are called from the main GUI.m file that should be ran in MATLAB. 
The Neural Network files are used to train the neural network. The Neural Network is already trained with the trained weights in the NN-Weights folder.
